You are an expert full-stack web developer.

Build a **simple browser-based order-taking website** for a local business that sells commodities like potatoes, onions, rice, and atta.

🌐 This is a **local mini-ERP system** made entirely with:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No backend server
- Use localStorage for all data storage
- No frameworks like React or Angular — keep it vanilla

📱 1. Customer Interface

🔓 a. Registration Page (first time only):
- Collect: Full Name, Phone Number, Shop Name (optional), Delivery Location
- Store in `localStorage`
- After registration, redirect to order page
- Don’t show this form again unless storage is cleared

🛒 b. Order Page (after registration):
- Display today's date (e.g., "Rates for 14 June 2025")
- Show product list organized into categories:
  - Example Categories: Potatoes, Onions, Rice, Flour/Atta
- Each product should show:
  - Product name
  - Rate (per package, e.g. per 50kg bag)
  - Input box to select number of packages
  - Auto-calculate total per item and grand total at bottom

🧾 Buttons:
- ✅ “Place Order” (save order in localStorage, shows confirmation)
- 📞 “Call Us” (uses `tel:+91XXXXXXXXXX`)
- 🔴 If store is OFF, disable form and show “Store is currently closed” notice

🔐 2. Admin Dashboard (`/admin` URL):
- Password protected (hardcoded password is okay)
- Only accessible via `www.example.com/admin` or `localhost/admin.html`

📋 Admin Features:
- ✅ View all registered customer details
- ✅ See customer orders
- ✅ Toggle Store ON/OFF
- ✅ Update product prices live
- ✅ Add new products within existing categories
- ✅ Add **new product categories** (e.g., Lentils, Sugar, etc.)
  - New categories should appear in customer view
- ✅ Export orders (CSV or JSON — optional bonus)
- ✅ All changes saved in localStorage and reflected instantly

📦 Product Data Model (stored in localStorage):
```js
{
  categories: [
    {
      name: "Potatoes",
      items: [
        { name: "Gulla", price: 520 },
        { name: "Pokhraj", price: 600 }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Rice",
      items: [
        { name: "Swastik Miniket", price: 1599 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
